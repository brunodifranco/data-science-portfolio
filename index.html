										<h1>About me</h1>
									</header>
										<h2 id="content"> I'm Bruno Di Franco Albuquerque</h2>
										<p align="justify"> I'm born and currently living in Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. As a Data Scientist I completed projects that are close to real-life company problems. I graduated in Economic Sciences at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) in July 2022.  Currently, I study Data Science on a daily basis. I have a career objective of getting a job as a Data Scientist and therefore help in finding solutions for business issues through data. </p>
										<p align="justify"> I graduated in Economic Sciences at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) in July 2022. Professionally, I worked as an intern in Banrisul, from May 2019 to May 2021. </p>
										<p align="justify"> I had my first contact with Data Science during my second year in college, when I took the Econometrics course in August 2019. In mid-2020, I learned Python by myself and took the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/ZWQ3NK8U7LY5?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_product=prof"> “IBM Data Science” </a> course on Coursera. Most recently, from January to May 2022, I once again used Data Science tools and knowledge in my final undergraduate paper, <a href="https://lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/238972">“Political News and Future Markets Returns”</a>. </p>
									    <p align="justify"> At this point in my career I feel confident to work as a Data Scientist, so that I can create value by using my knowledge in Python, Statistics, ML, Storytelling as well as other tools, in order to build data solutions that can solve companies' problems.</p>

										<h2 id="content" >3 Complete Data Science Projects </h2>
										<p align="justify"> Solving business problems that are close to real problems at various companies, using Data Science skills and publicly available data. 
											These solutions possess all main steps a Data Science solution should have: understanding the business problem, collecting and cleaning data, 
											feature engineering, going through exploratory data analysis, data preparation, feature selection, machine learning modeling, model evaluation, as well as translating model performance to financial and business results. Finally, deploying the final product by using a Cloud Computing tool.

										<p align="justify">Exploring the impacts of political news in Brazilian future markets returns, more specifically in U.S. Dollar Futures (DOL), BOVESPA Index Futures (IND) and 1-Day Interbank Deposits Futures (DI1), using Python, Time Series modeling with GARCH and Webscraping Techniques. Despite common sense, the results suggest no significant impact of political news on the volatility series for all three assets, and hence no significant impact in their respective returns.  </p>

											<h3> Creating a customer ranking system for an insurance company</h3>
											<p align="justify">In this Learning to Rank project I used Python, Flask and Classification Algorithms to create a client
												ranking system for Insuricare, a fictitious insurance company that is willing to sell a new vehicle insurance to new clients. 
												Insuricare already had a model that randomly selected customers to call, however, by using Data Science a full list of customers
												sorted by propensity score was provided, and for future clients a spreadsheet is available, returning the sorted propensity score
												for each requested client. Financially, with a very reasonable annual premium this solution could bring Insuricare up to US$ 25 million annually, 
												which is around 200% better than Insuricare's original model.

											<h3> Creating a bot that predicts Rossmann future sales</h3>
											<p align="justify">In this project I used Python, Flask and Regression Algorithms to predict Rossmann sales, 
												a drug store chain, six weeks in advance. Reason being Rossmann CEO needs to determine the best resource
												allocation for each store renovation. The final solution is a Telegram Bot that returns a sales prediction
												of any given available store number, with the possibility of being accessed from anywhere. <p>

											<h3> Business solution for a real estate company</h3>
											<p align="justify">In this insights project I used Python and Streamlit to solve a profit maximization problem for House Rocket, 
												a fictitious real estate company, by suggesting whether a property should or shouldn't be bought and resold. 
												If this feasible solution strategy were applied the total obtained profit would be around US$ 473 million, 
												with an average profit of 45 thousand dollars per property. </p>
