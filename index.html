										<h2 id="content" >5 Complete Data Science Projects </h2>
										<p align="justify"> Solving business problems that are close to real problems at various companies, using Data Science skills and publicly available data. 
											These solutions possess all main steps a Data Science solution should have: understanding the business problem, collecting and cleaning data, 
											feature engineering, going through exploratory data analysis, data preparation, feature selection, machine learning modeling, model evaluation, as well as translating model performance to financial and business results. Finally, deploying the final product by using a Cloud Computing tool.

										<p align="justify">Exploring the impacts of political news in Brazilian future markets returns, more specifically in U.S. Dollar Futures (DOL), BOVESPA Index Futures (IND) and 1-Day Interbank Deposits Futures (DI1), using Python, Time Series modeling with GARCH and Webscraping Techniques. Despite common sense, the results suggest no significant impact of political news on the volatility series for all three assets, and hence no significant impact in their respective returns.  </p>

											<h3> ETL Building for an E-commerce Jeans Company</h3>
											<p align="justify">In this data engineering project I used Python, Web Scraping and PostgresSQL to create an ETL process for Star Jeans,
												a fictitious company. Star Jeans' owners have just recently started the company, and for now, their plan is to sell male jeans in the USA through an E-commerce. 
												 However, this market already has strong competitors, such as H&M for instance. In addition to that, the owners aren't familiar with this segment in particular. 
												 Therefore, in order to better understand how this market works they hired a Data Science/Engineering, to gather information regarding H&M. 
												 The built solution is an ETL that extracts data from H&M website, cleans it, and saves it to a PostgreSQL database. 
												 Then, it adds and displays the database with filters in a Streamlit App, where it can be accessed from anywhere by Star Jeans' owners.
								
											<h4>Tools and techniques used:</h4>
											<ul>
												<li> Python, Pandas and Beautiful Soup.</li>
												<li> SQL and PostgresSQL.</li>												
												<li> Jupyter Notebook and VSCode.</li>
												<li> Web Scraping.</li>
												<li> ETL Process and Windows Task Scheduler.</li>
												<li> Streamlit.</li>

											<h3> Customer Loyalty Program for E-commerce</h3>
											<p align="justify">In this project I used Python, Power BI and Clustering Algorithms to create a customer loyalty program for Outleto, 
												a fictitious outlet company that sells its products through an E-commerce platform. Outleto's Marketing Team wishes to launch a customer loyalty program, 
												dividing the 5,702 customers in clusters, on which the best customers will be placed in a cluster named Insiders. To achieve this goal, 
												the Data Science Team was requested to provide a business report regarding the clusters, as well as a list of customers that will participate in Insiders. 
												With that report the Marketing Team will promote actions to each cluster, in order to increase revenue. 
												This project's Data Science Product is the final business report built in Power BI, by using Render Cloud and Google Drive.
									
											<h4>Tools and techniques used:</h4>
											<ul>
												<li> Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, SciPy and Pandas Profiling.</li>

											<h3> Creating a Customer Ranking System for an Insurance Company</h3>
											<p align="justify">In this Learning to Rank project I used Python, Flask and Classification Algorithms to create a client
												ranking system for Insuricare, a fictitious insurance company that is willing to sell a new vehicle insurance to new clients.
												The reason for ranking is to determine which customers to prioritize, given a limit call restriction.
												Insuricare already had a model that randomly selected customers to call, however, by using Data Science a full list of customers
												sorted by propensity score was provided, and for future clients a spreadsheet is available, returning the sorted propensity score
												for each requested client. Financially, with a very reasonable annual premium this solution could bring Insuricare up to US$ 25 million annually, 
												which is around 89% better than Insuricare's original model. 

											<h4>Tools and techniques used:</h4>

											<h3> Creating a Bot that Predicts Rossmann Future Sales</h3>
											<p align="justify">In this project I used Python, Flask and Regression Algorithms to predict Rossmann sales, 
												a drug store chain, six weeks in advance. Reason being Rossmann CEO needs to determine the best resource
												allocation for each store renovation. The final solution is a Telegram Bot that returns a sales prediction
												of any given available store number, with the possibility of being accessed from anywhere. <p>
											<h4>Tools and techniques used:</h4>

											<h3> Business Solution for a Real Estate Company</h3>
											<p align="justify">In this insights project I used Python and Streamlit to solve a profit maximization problem for House Rocket, 
												a fictitious real estate company, by suggesting whether a property should or shouldn't be bought and resold. 
												If this feasible solution strategy were applied the total obtained profit would be around US$ 473 million, 
												with an average profit of 45 thousand dollars per property. </p>
